This codebase is for the Animal Rescue software, which was developed to help animal rescue organisations keep track of the animals in their care. It allows users to see the list of animals, apply filters to find animals matching certain criteria, and search for animals by name. Animals can be added, marked as adopted, or deleted from the list. By default, animal data is stored in the animals.csv file, but the Save As and Load functions can be used to create and view additional csv files. The software also allows the user to create an adoption form for one or more animals, saving one adoption form for each animal as an image file with the animal details and adopter details automatically added, ready for printing. Users can also create an adoption poster which displays the information and pictures of the five animals that have been waiting the longest to be adopted.

The code can be launched by running main.py. The PIL, pandas and tkinter libraries are required.
